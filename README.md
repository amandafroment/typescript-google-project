# Google Maps Typescript Project

### Overview

<p>This quick project was built during a self-learning Typescript course that I took! The goal of the project was to integrate Google Maps with geolocation while practicing Typescript. This app was very basically styled, and as I continue to finish up my Typescript course, I hope to go back to this project and create a well designed page for users.</p>

### Technologies

<p>This application was built with HTML, CSS, and Typescript. Google Maps API was used in order to generate a map with the Google Maps geolocation API.</p>
